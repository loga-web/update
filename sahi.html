  <p>Roblox is a global platform that brings people together through play.
    Roblox (/ˈroʊblɒks/) is an online game platform and game creation system
     developed by Roblox Corporation that allows users to program games and
      play games created by other users. Created by David Baszucki and Erik
       Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games
        of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's
         history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company.</p>
